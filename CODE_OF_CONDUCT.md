# Code of Conduct

## Overview

üíù Welcome to the Logto Community!

We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community where everyone is treated with respect and kindness. As members, contributors, and leaders in this community, we pledge to uphold these values and create a safe space for all, regardless of race, age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We will strive to act in ways that promote open communication, diversity, inclusivity, and a healthy community for all. This code of conduct applies both online and offline, and we hope that it will be observed in other related groups and forums as well.

Please take a few minutes to read through them. Thank you again for being a part of our community, and we look forward to building a positive and supportive space for everyone. üôèüèº

## Rules

### No hate speech or harassment

We want our community to be a safe and welcoming space for everyone. Please avoid using language or behavior that is disrespectful, discriminatory, or hurtful to others. This includes hate speech, harassment, bullying, or any other form of abuse.

### Keep it clean

Let's maintain a professional and respectful environment by avoiding offensive usernames, profile pictures, or other content that might make others uncomfortable. We want everyone to feel comfortable and included in our community.

### Context is the key

If you're asking for help or advice, please provide as much context as possible. This will help others better understand your situation and provide more relevant responses. Posts without context may be ignored, as it's difficult for others to provide help without knowing the specifics.

### Use threads

To keep the conversation organized and easy to follow, please use threads when possible (for example, in the Discord server). This will help avoid cluttering the main channel with unrelated or off-topic messages. Let's make it easy for others to find the information they need.

### Utilize documentation and search

We encourage you to read the relevant documentation before asking a question. Many common questions can be answered by reviewing [official documentation](https://docs.logto.io/).

Moreover, it‚Äôs important to take a moment to search the existing threads to see if your question has already been answered. This will not only save you time and effort, but also prevent the community from being flooded with repetitive questions. If you can‚Äôt find the answer you‚Äôre looking for, feel free to post a new question. 

### This isn't Customer Support

While we encourage everyone to help each other out, please understand that this is not a customer service channel. While we'll do our best to assist with any questions you may have, we can't guarantee a response to every inquiry. If you require business assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us via [email](contact@logto.io).
