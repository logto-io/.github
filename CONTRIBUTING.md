# (Draft) Contributing convention

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Logto. We respect the time of community contributors, so it'll be great if we can go through this convention which provides the necessary contribution information before starting your work.

## Commit and create pull request

We require every commit to [be signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits), and both the commit message and pull request title follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

You can find repo-specific config in `commitlint.config.js`, if applicable.

If the pull request remains empty content, it'll be DIRECTLY CLOSED until it matches our contributing guideline.
